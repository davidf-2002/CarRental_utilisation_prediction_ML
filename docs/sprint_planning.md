# Machine Learning Model with Streamlit Dashboard - Sprint Planning

## Sprint 1 (Current Sprint)

### Data Preprocessing and Model Development
1. Set up project structure and environment
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Create virtual environment
   - Set up basic project folders (src, data, models, docs)

2. Data Processing Pipeline
   - Create data loading utilities
   - Implement data cleaning functions
   - Feature engineering pipeline
   - Data splitting (train/test)

3. Model Development
   - Implement baseline model
   - Model training pipeline
   - Model evaluation metrics
   - Model serialization/saving

4. Basic Streamlit Dashboard
   - Set up basic Streamlit app structure
   - Create data visualization components
   - Implement model prediction interface
   - Basic styling and layout

### Deliverables
- Working ML model with basic predictions
